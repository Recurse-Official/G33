# G33 - QRYPTO KNIGHTS
Our goal is to create a future-proof chat platform using quantum-encryption algorithms like Kyber and Dilithium. We call it the Schrodinger's Chat.

For kyber and dilithium implementation. Please clone the following repositories and run the code.
https://github.com/GiacomoPope/dilithium-py.git
https://github.com/GiacomoPope/kyber-py.git

The folders involved in making a chat platform using RSA Encryption are:
1.backend:it is used for  RSA backend especially uses MERN with socket.io
2.frontend : is used for the UserInterface(UI) of the platform.
The files involved in demonstrating Lattice Encrypting Algorithms and Onion Routing are:
1.comms.py : the file containg the simple implementation of Kyber and Dilithium algorithms.
2.client.py, server.py, crypto_utils.py : simple and client server interaction with kyber and dilithium implemented
3. onion_routing.py:  onion routing with Kyber and Dilithium
4.kyber-py and dilithium-py: repositories from which we used kyber and dilitium
